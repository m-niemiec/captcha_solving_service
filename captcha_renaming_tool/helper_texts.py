Welcome in Captcha Renaming Tool!\n\n

Press "Select Folder" to select folder where your captcha/images are stored.\n
On top you will see buttons "Zoom IN", "Zoom OUT" and "B&W Mode".\n

After that, you can just start to type new names for your files and press ENTER.\n
ENTER will save the new name and automatically go to the next image.\n
Arrows UP and DOWN will show next and previous images.\n\n
